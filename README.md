# **The Great Bitwise Bake Off: Recipe Generator**

## **Overview**

This project is a recipe generator that uses a **genetic algorithm** to create unique, culturally diverse, and low-calorie cake and cookie recipes. It optimizes ingredient combinations and caloric content, allowing users to explore creative, health-conscious recipes with a blend of traditional and new ingredients.

## **Project Files**

- **`index.html`**: The main HTML file for the web-based interface.
- **`sketch.js`**: The JavaScript file responsible for handling the recipe generation logic.
- **`recipes_original.json`**: The dataset containing the knowledgebase of original recipes, used as input for the recipe generator.
- **`style.css`**: Stylesheet for the webpage design.
- **`p5.js`** & **`p5.sound.min.js`**: JavaScript libraries used to power the interactive visual and sound elements of the recipe generator.

## **How the Recipe Generator Works**

The recipe generator uses a **genetic algorithm** to evolve recipes by adjusting ingredients and balancing calories. By drawing from a curated knowledgebase of traditional recipes from Japan, China, and Iran, the generator evolves recipes while maintaining a focus on cultural diversity and health consciousness.

### **Key Features**:
- Ingredient optimization based on caloric content and recipe balance.
- Cultural diversity integrated into the recipe set.
- Visual representation of the generated recipes using **DALL-E** and **Stable Diffusion**.
